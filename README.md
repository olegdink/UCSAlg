# UCSAlg - Uniform Cost Search (UCS) implementation on PHP

Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a tree search algorithm related to breadth-first search. Whereas breadth-first search determines a path to the goal state that has the least number of edges, uniform cost search determines a path to the goal state that has the lowest weight.
